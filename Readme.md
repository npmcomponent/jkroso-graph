The input graph must be acyclic (no circular dependencies).## Running the testsRunning the test in node is just a matter of executing `make test`Running in the browser though requires a build.

You should then be able to open your browser to the test directory and watch the suite run._Note: before you can run any tests you will need to execute `npm install` and nothing works on a windows pc_## License[MIT](License)
